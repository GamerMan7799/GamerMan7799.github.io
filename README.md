I am also part of the [Dragon Wonder Organization](https://github.com/Dragon-Wonder), which is just myself and a friend working together on some projects.

    * Program that takes in a number and converts to its equivalent Greek letter combination. (1 is Alpha, 24 is Omega, 25 is Alpha Alpha, etc...)
    * The point of the program is that when I am learning a new programming language I'll usually write this program because it is simple but allows me to learn important aspects of the programming language.
